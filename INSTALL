How to compile this package:

Its really quite simple -- its about the same difficulty as compiling
any GNU software (however, this is _not_ GNU software)

  o  !!! IMPORTANT !!! If you are upgrading from a prior version of
     your operating system, or you have changed operating systems, you
     must do a 'make distclean' and re-do all of the steps in this file
     for the new OS, or epic may get confused when it tries to compile 
     for your old system!  (Especially true for Redhat 5.2 to 6.1)

  o  Run 'configure' by using one (and only one) of the following:

		./configure
		sh configure

  o  By default, 'configure' sets up the software to be run from
     /usr/local -- if this is not the case for you (ie, you are not
     the superuser compiling for the entire system) you can run
     configure with the "--prefix=/path/to/somewhere" flag, for example:

		./configure --prefix=/usr/home/user

  o  EPIC's build infrastructure fully supports all the bells and whistles
     that configure provides for compiling in different places and for
     different systems and all that esoteric stuff only used by package
     maintainers.  This support was added because Debian asked for it.

  o  On Linux, you _*-MUST-*_ install your system's "ncurses-devel" package
     or you won't be able to build epic.  You should install your system's
     "gdbm-devel" package or you won't have access to $dbmctl() (hash tables)

  o  There are several options supported by our configure script:
	  --with-termcap     	
		EPIC will use ONLY termcap, and not look for terminfo.
		You ought not specify this unless the terminfo support
		on your system is more broken than your termcap support.
	  --with-perl[=PATH]
		Enable the perl support in the scripting language.
		WARNING:  Currently requires Perl 5.6+.
	  --with-ssl[=PATH]
		Enable support for SSL connections to servers.

  o  This version of EPIC requires a C99 compiler.  Compiling on very
     old operating systems or compilers is (sadly) no longer likely to 
     work.  You'll just have to use an older version of EPIC on older
     operating systems -- sorry!

  o  To compile type `make'.  This will compile the `epic5' and `wserv4'
     programs that live in the `source' subdirectory.

  o  Once that you are happy with the compilation, you can install them
     with `make install'.  This will install all the binaries, and scripts
     into the path specified in the Makefile (or when you ran configure).
     The help files are available as a seperate package.  They should be
     available from the same place you got the source code from.
     This release uses a new layout format for its various parts that differs
     from the historical ircII defaults.  The binary is called 'epic5', the
     library is put into .../share/epic by default, and the 'wserv4'
     binary ends up as .../libexec/wserv4.

  o  You can now delete the object files and binaries if you want to
     save some space by typing `make clean'.  If you are sure you probably
     wont have to compile again, but you want to keep the source code
     around, you can use `make distclean'.  You should `make distclean'
     before you try to compile again for a different architecture.

  o  Help files are not shipped with the base distribution (because of their
     size and because they are not updated frequently.)  You can peruse the 
     help files online at http://help.epicsol.org/   There is also a 'help'
     script that implements the /help command if you want to do things the old
     way.  Make sure you /SET HELP_PATH to where you put the help files or it
     won't be able to find them.

  o  Bug reports go to list@epicsol.org.  Please see the BUG_FORM file for 
     information about how to file a bug report.  Please include as much 
     information as possible.
