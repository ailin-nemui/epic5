# the first input line contains words, the first of which is the key,
# and additional arguments, which aren't used right now, so they are
# discarded.

# When the end of the line is reached, the rest of the input is to be
# read as binary input of the plaintext or cyphertext in _binary_ mode.
# What this means for plaintext is that the newline terminator won't
# be present.
