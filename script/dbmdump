# Here's the plan
#
# I need a script that dumps what's in an (n)dbm file, since there aren't a 
# lot of tools that support them any more.  Maybe I should be using some other 
# file format....

alias dbmdump (filename, ...) {
	@ :dbm = dbmctl(OPEN STD $filename);
	@ :key = dbmctl(NEXT_KEY $dbm 1);
	do
	{
		@ :value = dbmctl(READ $dbm $key);
		echo $filename - $key - $db = $value;
	}
	while ((key = dbmctl(NEXT_KEY $dbm 0)));
};
