EPIC5 Projects, Bugs, and other Errata:

THINGS TO WORK ON
------------------------------------------------
Actual bugs
===========
* Sending a "Man shrugging medium-light skin tone"
  https://emojipedia.org/man-shrugging-medium-light-skin-tone
  is a "ZWJ sequence" which epic may not support correctly
   [ 5:34PM] -> (#epic) https://imgur.com/a/46IUXP0   -- how it originally appeared as received  (expected behavior per github)
   [ 5:34PM] -> (#epic) https://imgur.com/a/P8gEFnG   -- how it appeared after you swapped the window out and in again
   [ 5:35PM] -> (#epic) https://imgur.com/a/lSlLqQE   -- how it appeared in the log (text) file

Creature Comforts
====================
* /window maximize + new status expando when a zero-height window gets output
* Be able to retrieve/cycle through "next notified (activity) window"

Data improvements
===================
* Rethink "targets" with channels and queries 
* Change /ignore to support broader patterns (servers, nicks, etc)
* Support "virtual timestamps" -- don't fetch the real time
* Support ZNC's CAP that prefixes timestamp (see above)

Weaknesses
===========
* The way we handle "screen is not tall enough" underflow needs work
* Typing 😂😂(multi-column emojis) upsets screen.
* I don't think /msg @L1 is implemented correctly
	files.c:file_write() for type == 2
* Revisit why we do not use padding for openssl ("wrong final block length")
	/eval echo $xform("+AESSHA +B64" test 1)   [rb zlonix]

Foundational improvements
===========================
* Mouse support (for fusion)
* Unlimited size input line with auto-chonking
* Outbound flood control for irc servers
* Properly support 005 PREFIX=(qaohv)~&@%+
* Properly support CAP
	https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-mitchell-irc-capabilities-01
* Rewrite the RFC1459 message tokenizer ("BreakArgs")
    - Make CAP tokens (@stupid=value) first class citizens somehow

[I moved the old list to the file "WISHLIST" to keep this file short]

* Add $xform(iconv +<iconv id>) functionality. (See UPDATES.)
* Fix bug where /window number could lead to confused lastlogs
* Generalize base64 encoding so it doesn't hardcode the base64 string.
* Add $xform(+FISH64 ...) which does FiSH's base64 encoding.

* Fix various warnings revealed by gcc warnings
* Make a very preliminary attempt to write some fish decoding stuff. Not Ready!
* Fix for configure to handle perl's non-existance (kreca)

* Rework the ruby checking in configure so it builds on freebsd-7
* Add CTCP FISH support (this is _not_ fish support!), see UPDATES
* Make an initial stab at proper support for FiSH's base64 converter.
* I took the "fish64" entry out of $xform() for now while it's broken.
* Capture stdout of ruby scripts and send it to an epic window. yay!
* This means you can do regular old 'puts' in ruby script and it'll Just Work.

* New file, wcwidth.c, utf8<->unicode conversion, unicode column counting.
* Revamp /INPUT system to be utf8 aware.  callback 2nd arg is now const.
* Specifically, save the state of the input line across /INPUTs.
* -- This is stub code. needs to be completely fleshed out.
* Reformat keys.c so I can work with it easier
* Only bytes < 127 can now participate in binds.  >= 128 are SELF_INSERT.
* I think the keybinding system can grow 'namespaces' which might be cool.
* The TRANSPOSE_CHARACTERS keybinding has passed away quietly.
* New keybinding DEBUG_INPUT_LINE to help me

* The ability to 'fake' input in dumb mode has passed away quietly.
* Completely revamp input.c to work with inputline data structure
* Change input line so users operate on "logical characters"
* Inputline data structure maps "logical characters" to bytes in input buffer.
* It's almost too overwhelming to describe specific details.
* Basically the input system accepts unicode code points, and stores in utf8.
* Things like cursor movement, column counting, side scrolling all Just Work.
* Even things like cut buffering work.
* HOWEVER -- it seems this stuff doesn't work in GNU screen. can't fix this. :/
* Internal function strext2() allows me to cut substrings out, for input buf.
* Fix input_delete_character(), it forgot to call retokenize_input()
* Fix term_inputline_putchar() so it doesn't mangle 0x9b (valid utf8 char)
* Fix $curpos(), sort of.  Does this return byte offset or column offset?
* 	It used to be the same, but now it's not!
* InputLine.buffer_pos isn't used any more.  Whack that.
* Test every keybinding, fix the ones that are broken.
* Fix handling of highlight chars
* Add "number_of_logical_chars" to input line so we can boundary check eol.
* Error if you try to /bind a high bit char -- that's illegal now.
* Test and fix composed characters (for mac os x)
* Teach the normalize_string, prepare_display, and output_with_count about utf8
* Since utf8 parsing is "consumptive", some utility funcs changed too

* Translate screen output to /encoding console setting
* Non-utf8 users now appear as utf8 users to irc!
* UTF8 users now appear as non-utf8 users to non-utf8 epic users!
* Automatically recode undeclared non-utf8 scripts using /encoding scripts
* Add Emojis (unicode 6) to the column counting code (rb Kitambi)
* Set /ENCODING CONSOLE automatically to nl_langinfo(CODESET) from LC_ALL.
* If the default codeset is "US-ASCII" then it's changed to ISO-885-1.
* In translate_user_input() try to detect utf8 typers using non-utf8 encodings
* Tell user if we're recoding a script at /load time.

* Comment out some stuff in term.c that isn't being used.
* Re-implement status repeat-char-fill for utf8. (rb fudd)
* Fix /xtype -l to be UTF-8 aware. (rb zlonix)
* When status updates are suppressed, make a note if an attempt is tried
* When status updates are permitted again, do an update_all_status() if defered
* Make /set lastlog do a scrollback redraw to "dispose" of extra lines
* Make /set lastlog refuse to set to a value < twice the biggest window.
* However, doing /set lastlog 0 WILL delete everything and clear every window.
* Have configure auto-detect your "local" directory (/usr/local|opt|/usr/pkg)
* Have configure use the auto-detected local directory.
* Reformat some parts of server.c
* Change the current window whenever we're processing server stuff.
