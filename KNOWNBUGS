EPIC5 Projects, Bugs, and other Errata:

KNOWN ERRATA (eg, bugs, or unresolved requests):
------------------------------------------------
* /set scroll_lines <X> crashes if <X> is greater than your window size.
* Add /window scroll_lines
* Implied on hooks still result in Unmatched { errors if you type { because
  of the run-through expand_alias!
* Document the wikihelp for lastlog with stuff like -context.
* Don't include termcap stuff if we're using terminfo, it conflicts.
* Unique refnums for scrollback items in windows?
* There needs to be timeouts for /dcc get or /dcc chat

ISSUES OF INTEREST
------------------
* Re-implement /set cmdchars
* You should be able to /msg @logfile
* You should be able to move lastlog items between windows, split, merge.
* Shattah would like something like /window omit <regex> to remove stuff.
* Rewrite the input prompt to use a linked list instead of a C string.
* I would like to be able to /load zip files and put them into LOAD_PATH.
* Normalize 'proto', 'type', and 'addrfamily' values with server stuff.
* Undernet's CPRIVMSG and CNOTICE allow chanops to msg members w/o penalty
* You can't move a window to a different screen atomically (you must hide it)
* Howl wants a temporary hold mode that expires when you reach bottom.
* Everybody wants utf8 support -- but who will volunteer to help me?
* There should be something internally that detects pastes.
* What about pastes with "rogue characters" like ³ (alt-3, ie, ^[3) ?
* The way dcc filenames are handled is bad; you should be able to seamlessly
  rewrite filenames both outbound and inbound.  URL encoding should auto-detect
* There should be an /on send_encrypted_msg, /on send_encrypted_public, etc.
* IRCII supports "default" fg/bg colors, which looks intriguing.
* Larne would like to use 256-color-support for xterm.
  ^[[48;5;<color>m   <color> = 16 + (red * 36) + (green * 6) + blue
* Larne would like a ==== that appears at his last scrollback ponit.
* Larne wants suppression of duplicated lines (like syslog maybe?)
* Remove all the hardcoded uses of select() so it isn't mandatory.
* Zlonix wants a way to be notified when window geometry changes
* Jm would like an /xdebug inbound type facility for dcc raw connections.
* Jm thinks regex support for /switch would be nice.
* How about base85 support for $xform() ?
* Zlonix would like per-screen toplines
* Output rules
* Pegasus wants a way to send italics (^I)
* Kreca mentions that word manip functions strip extraneous spaces.
* If @ var = [encode] you should be able to do $($var)(args) to call it.
* Krisp wants a log that only logs what is not logged somewhere else.
* UPnP support (http://miniupnp.free.fr) would fix dcc-behind-firewall dilema.
* <twincest> hop: i would like a function that erases the last 10 lines of the
  +display and replaces them with the output of /lastlog 10
  <twincest> (obviously, for any number, not just 10 ;-)
  <twincest> since i use lastlog_rewrite to timestamp the log, that would allow
  +me to insert timestamps without duplicating text
  <twincest> also, i would like a way to temporarily disable window updates
  <twincest> so i can do /window upate off; /lastlog; /window update on
  <twincest> and it outputs the lastlog without me having to wait for the entire
  +thing to be drawn
  <twincest> it would just appear in the scrollback

* Re-indent stuff while here

* Check side-scrolling in input_move_cursor() instead of update_input()
* This means moving the cursor w/o using input_move_cursor() is verboten!!

* Revamp the keybindings that move the cursor for the new api semantics.
* End of stuff contributed by fusion (alex)
