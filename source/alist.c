 *
 * If ``cnt'' is less than -1, then there was one exact match and one or
 *	more ambiguous matches in addition.  The exact match's location 
 *	is put into ``loc'' and its entry is returned.  The ambigous matches
 *	are (of course) immediately subsequent to it.
 *
 * If ``cnt'' is -1, then there was one exact match.  Its location is
 *	put into ``loc'' and its entry is returned.
 *
 * If ``cnt'' is zero, then there were no matches for ``name'', but ``loc''
 * 	is set to the location in the array in which you could place the
 * 	specified name in the sorted list.
 *
 * If ``cnt'' is one, then there was one command that non-ambiguously 
 * 	completes ``name''
 *
 * If ``cnt'' is greater than one, then there was exactly ``cnt'' number
 *	of entries that completed ``name'', but they are all ambiguous.
 *	The entry that is lowest alphabetically is returned, and its
 *	location is put into ``loc''.
