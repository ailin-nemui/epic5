*** News 02/03/2003 -- Implement /SET SUPPRESS_SERVER_MOTD in script
	If you were a previous user of /SET SUPPRESS_SERVER_MOTD ON,
	then you will want to add 
			load suppressmotd
	to your ~/.ircrc.  This re-implements this /SET.  And hopefully
	this script actually works, unlike the /SET.  If you have any
	problems, let me know, and I'll try to fix it.  If you want to
	try to improve it, please feel free and send me patches.

	Make sure you do a 'make install' before you report not being
	able to load this script as a bug!

*** News 02/03/2003 -- $logctl(REFNUMS [ACTIVE|INACTIVE|ALL])
	You can now do the following things with logfiles:
		$logctl(REFNUMS ACTIVE)
			returns all ACTIVE (on) logfiles
		$logctl(REFNUMS INACTIVE)
			returns all INACTIVE (off) logfiles
		$logctl(REFNUMS ALL)
			returns all logfiles

*** News 02/03/2003 -- Logs now keep track of "last written time"
	Each logfile now has an "activity timer" which is reset when
	you first create the logfile, when you turn it on, or when you
	turn it off, or when any output is written to the logfile.
	You can work with this timer in the following ways:

		$logctl(GET <refnum> ACTIVITY)
			returns the last time the logfile was written to
		$logctl(SET <refnum> ACTIVITY)
			resets the log file's activity timer to current time
		/LOG <refnum> ACTIVITY
			resets the log file's activity timer to current time

*** News 02/03/2003 -- "Larnifications" to epic's server handling code
	Traditionally, ircII clients have trusted the server to send
	well formed data.  If messages from the server were badly formed
	(for example, if arguments were missing or in the wrong order),
	ircII clients (including epic of course) would crash.  Due to the
	repeated requests of some server developers, and particularly 
	because of larne, who used to make sport of epic by modifying his
	server to send numeric garbage at epic to make it crash, a long
	and substantial project to rewrite all of the code that handles
	messages from the server has been undertaken.  This marks the end
	of the first stage of the project, which protects epic from the
	server sending not enough arguments, which would cause a crash.
	Internally, I have referred to this as the "larnification project"
	in honor of larne, the person who pushed me over the edge into 
	doing this sooner rather than later.  I got his consent to use his
	nickname like this, so please don't think I'm making fun of him.
	For history's sake, this is an offshoot of the previous project
	which was called "Larneproofing" which was a band-aid to prevent
	most of the obvious problems caused by server's sending bad data.
	This was a full rewrite of the protocol-handling code.

*** News 02/03/2003 -- Changes to how and when notifies are done
	Previously, NOTIFY events always occured at the top of every minute,
	along with other things like the updating of the system clock and
	/on timer.  But now NOTIFY has been broken off into its own separate
	timer whose interval is controlled by /SET NOTIFY_INTERVAL (see below).
	How this will work is that each notify event will occur precisely
	/SET NOTIFY_INTERVAL seconds apart, except for the following cases!

	*) When the client starts up, the first notify event occurs at the
	   top of the next minute *without regard to whatever the original
	   value of /SET NOTIFY_INTERVAL is!*  After this first notify 
	   event, the normal rules apply.
	*) When you enter CPU_SAVER mode, the next notify event will occur 
	   at its regular scheduled time, but subsequent notify events will
	   occur at /SET CPU_SAVER_EVERY intervals!  (IE, /SET CPU_SAVER_EVERY
	   overrides /SET NOTIFY_INTERVAL when you're in cpu saver mode)
	*) When you leave CPU_SAVER mode, the next notify event will occur
	   at the top of the next minute *without regard to whatever value
	   of /set notify_interval!  After the top of the next minute, the
	   regular rules apply.

	These rules are needed to maintain as much backwards compatability
	as much as possible for most users, who will not change anything.

*** News 02/03/2003 -- Changes to /SET NOTIFY_INTERVAL
	There is a new #define in config.h, #define MINIMUM_NOTIFY_INTERVAL
	which is an integer value that sets the minimum permissable value
	of /SET NOTIFY_INTERVAL.  If you attempt to /SET to a lower value,
	it will be change to the minimum value.  The default value is 60,
	and you can change it in config.h if you wish.

*** News 02/03/2003 -- Changes to /ON WINDOW_KILL
	Previously, /ON WINDOW_KILL provided the window's "name or refnum"
	as $0.  But if you wanted to get the refnum, you couldn't because
	the window had already been destroyed.  So /ON WINDOW_KILL has been
	extended so $1 is always the window's refnum:
		$0	Window's "name or refnum"
		$1	Window's refnum

*** News 01/30/2003 -- $serverctl() general cleanup.
	subcommands will be matched against as many characters as are
	supplied.  This means that $serverctl(get 4 007) will not call the
	005 subcommand for eg, but also that in ambiguous cases, the first
	matching subcommand is used where they may not have been before.

*** News 01/30/2003 -- $serverctl(?match *pattern*) does wildcard matching.
	gmatch will return all servers matching group *pattern*.
	imatch will return all servers matching (its) server name *pattern*.
	omatch will return all servers matching (our) server name *pattern*.
	match was never implemented and has been removed.
	pmatch was never implemented and has been removed.

*** News 01/30/2003 -- $serverctl(max)
	$serverctl(max) now returns the number of _slots_ in the server
	list.  Note that this currently equates to the largest number
	of servers in the list at any one time.  It doesn't shrink if
	you delete servers.

*** News 01/30/2003 -- $afterw(), $beforew(), $fromw(), $tow()..
	WARNING:  Incompatible change.  If you experience problems
	because of this change, you should notify #epic on efnet.

	These functions will now do fixed string matching rather than
	pattern matching.  I figure that the old method of implementing
	these functions is fundamentally flawed, and not useful for real
	world applications.  Examination of many publicly available
	scripts seems to indicate that these functions are avoided and
	that where they are used, they constitute latent bugs since text
	matching is desired.

*** News 01/30/2003 -- $writeb() dequotes data.
	This makes it capable of writing binary data.
	$writeb($writefd $read($readfd $numbytes)) will copy $numbytes
	of binary data from one FD to the other faithfully.

*** News 01/30/2003 -- Subsecond /sleep.
	/sleep now accepts floating point arguments.  This makes it much
	the same as /usleep which accepts integer microsecond values,
	but not entirely.

*** News 12/23/2002 -- /exec options tuned.
	-line, -linepart, -error and -errorpart can now be changed for a
	process on the fly, using %process like the other options.

	Using the -window option will now nail the process to the server
	too.

*** News 12/23/2002 -- $xdebug() now accepts masks.

*** News 12/23/2002 -- /redir tuned
	/redir now permits raw dccs to be used.  Also, when used outside
	of the command line script, the $* arguments will now be available.

*** News 12/23/2002 -- New /set, /set FLOATING_POINT_PRECISION
	This sets the number of decimal places of the results of floating
	point math.  Note that this makes FLOATING_POINT_MATH redundant.
