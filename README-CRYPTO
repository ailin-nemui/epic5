This version of EPIC5 may contain strong cryptographic code which is
export-controlled from the USA.  In accordance with USA export controls
governing the export of munitions-grade cryptography in open-source software,
we have sent notice to the USA government about our anonymous publication
of the EPIC5 source code, in the following message:

	Message-ID: <013301c46447$d1ee7da0$369cfa04@2mbit.com>
	From: "Brian Bruns" <bruns@2mbit.com>
	To: <crypt@bis.doc.gov>, <enc@ncsc.mil>
	Date: Wed, 7 Jul 2004 13:28:20 -0400
	Subject: Notification under 740.13e about exporting open source 
                 software with crypto

It is our understanding that only "original exporters" need to perform
this step, and sites that slavishly mirror the original export do not
need to disclose to the government.  HOWEVER, NOTWITHSTANDING THIS, THIS
IS NOT LEGAL ADVICE AND WE SUGGEST YOU DO NOT DEPEND ON OUR UNDERSTANDING 
IN LIEU OF YOUR LEGAL OBLIGATIONS.  We are not lawyers and we cannot defend
you if our understanding is incorrect.

However, you may be considered an "original exporter" if you make
modifications to the source code, for example as a necessary step in porting
EPIC5 to a new system.  You would probably do well to disclose your port
to the government in accordance with all applicable laws.
