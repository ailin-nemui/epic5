This document details the conversion of EPIC into an IPv6 program.  If this
document can be made use to anyone else, they are welcome to it.

EPIC is a particularly interesting case study for IPv4 to IPv6 transition
because it touches every direction of every domain.  It is (obviously)
an IPv4 client, but it is also an IPv4 server (DCCs).  It is a Unix Domain
client, and it can be a Unix Domain server (but this is not in use).

Fortunately for us, all of the networking related code is contained in three
subsystems (/DCC, /SERVER, and /WINDOW CREATE), and five modules: dcc.c,
network.c, screen.c, server.c, and wserv.c.

EPIC has traditionally retained and stored data on an "ad hoc" basis.  Whenever
a piece of data is needed, it is retrieved from whatever place is the most
convenient and stashed away in a variable.  This means that some data we keep
in multiple places (redundancy).  An example:  the result of a hostname lookup
is an in_addr which we store as the "remote address" of the peer.  After the
connect(2), getpeername(2) returns a struct sockaddr which also contains this
"remote address".  Now we have two copies of the same information.  The 
maintainer then is left to wonder why we have two different copies and what
each copy is to be used for.

The first thing to do is take a catalog of all the data items used to store
networking information.  This includes in_addr's, sockaddr's, and what they
are used for and why they are kept.  We can then design a more efficient
and practical list of data items stored.
